  "longDescription": "Transmission is an open source, volunteer-based project. Unlike some BitTorrent clients, Transmission doesn''t play games with its users to make money:  Transmission doesn''t bundle toolbars, pop-up ads, flash ads, twitter tools, or anything else. It doesn''t hold some features back for a payware version. Its source code is available for anyone to review. We don''t track our users, and our website and forums have no third-party ads or analytics.\n",
