  "description": "The Unifi network application software is a powerful, enterprise wireless software engine ideal for high-density client deployments requiring low latency and high uptime performance.",
  "longDescription": "Only mandatory ports are enabled by default, to extend functionality consider exposing 1900:1900/udp, 8843:8843, 8880:8880, 6789:6789, 5514:5514/udp.\nOther ports specifications [here](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-unifi-network-application/#ports-p).\n\nBecause the network application runs inside Docker by default it uses an IP address not accessible by other devices.\nSo, for it to adopt other devices, it is required to use port `8080` and change the inform IP address. To do so, go in settings and search for the `Inform Host` option, there select override and set the address to that of the host.\nOften, it is also needed to ssh into the devices you want to adopt and manually set the inform IP address, the command needed for doing so is `set-inform http://HOST-ADDRESS:8080/inform`.\n\nFor more [information](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-unifi-network-application/)\n",
